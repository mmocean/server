http_proxy demo
===============

1.Overview
--------
This program is designed to show how a proxy works under HTTP(Hyper Text Transport Protocol), now it supports multi-process and multi-thread.

It is written in C, but my development paltform is Liunx(Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS), I can not ensure it works in other paltforms(e.g. Unix, Hpux) as was expected.

Since this is only a demo, if you get these source files, build, run this program, and find out some bugs to report,mail to:lihaiyangcsu@gmail.com. You are really welcome! ^_^


2.How to get a cpoy of source code?
--------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/mmocean/server


3.How to build this program?
-------------------------
Suppose your program directory is ${server}, to bulid it, type commands in this order:

command line> cd ${server}
command line> aclocal
command line> autoheader
command line> autoconf
command line> automake -a
command line> ./configure
command line> make

Now you should succeed, but no arguments [./configure] does not make sense, we should sepcify one of arguments below:
--enable-MULTI_PTHREAD=yes MULTI_PROCESS is default
--enable-SERVER=yes as a tcp server
--enable-PROXY=yes as a normal proxy server
--enable-HTTP_PROXY=yes as a http_proxy server

e.g.
command line> ./configure --enable-SERVER=yes

build to be a simple normal tcp server.

you can use [./configure --help] to view more options.

4.How to launch this program?
----------------------------
4.1 normal tcp server && http proxy
command line> ./server -l 8087

4.2 normal proxy 
command line> ./server -l 8087 -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8088

5.Possible improvement 
----------------------
	support pselect/poll
	support epoll(Linux)
	cache static data
